If you're looking for FOSS projects here, I'm sorry to say that GitHub isn't the
place to look for.

My main problem with GitHub is the fact that your code can be used for training
AIs (Copilot, looking at you) disregarding the license which those projects are
under. Using FOSS projects without respecting the license is something I find
troubling, and I don't have to contribute to that.

"[GitHub Copilot and open source laundering][ddevault_github_copilot]", by Drew
DeVault, explains this in better detail.

Also, I prefer to use FOSS platforms for FOSS projects, and [GitHub is a
propietary SaaS][wuzzy_github].

More issues with GitHub:

- [My issue with Github (and Microsoft buying it)][lanodan_github].
- [Give Up GitHub!][sfconservancy_github].
- [Please donâ€™t upload my code to GitHub][codeberg_github].
- [Migration from GitHub to Codeberg][daudix_github].

This is why GitHub for me is now a purely a tool to contribute to projects
rather than hosting my own. In the future, who really knows if this will
change...

If you want to find my projects, I suggest you visit
[codeberg.org/captainepoch][codeberg_captainepoch].

Find me also at my personal website at [adol.pw][adolpw].
